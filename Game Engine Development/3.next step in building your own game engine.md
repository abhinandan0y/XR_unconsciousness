#### The next step in building your own game engine would be to start implementing some of the core features that you will need. Here are some suggestions for features that you might want to consider implementing:

Mesh Loading and Rendering: 
```You will need to be able to load 3D models from files and render them on the screen. You can use a library like Assimp to load models in various formats, and then use OpenGL to render them.
```

Camera Controls: 
```You will need to implement camera controls so that the user can move around the scene. This will involve handling input from the keyboard and mouse, and updating the camera's position and orientation accordingly.```
Lighting and Shading: 
```You will need to implement lighting and shading models to make your scenes look more realistic. This will involve writing shaders in GLSL to calculate the lighting and shading of each object in the scene.```
Physics Engine:
```You will need to implement a physics engine to handle collisions and other physical interactions between objects in the scene. You can use a library like Bullet Physics to help with this.```
Animation System: 
```You will need to implement an animation system to handle character animations and other animated objects in the scene. This will involve loading animation data from files and using it to animate the objects.```
Audio System:
```You will need to implement an audio system to play sounds and music in your game. You can use a library like OpenAL or FMOD to help with this.```
Scripting System: 
```You will need to implement a scripting system to allow game designers to create gameplay logic without having to write C++ code. You can use a library like Lua or Python to help with this.
```
User Interface System: 
```You will need to implement a user interface system to allow the user to interact with the game. This will involve creating menus, buttons, and other UI elements, and handling user input.```
Networking System: 
```You will need to implement a networking system to allow multiple players to play together over the internet. This will involve implementing client-server architecture and handling network communication.
```
Game Engine Architecture:
```You will need to design and implement a robust and flexible game engine architecture that can handle all of these features and more. This will involve designing a modular system that can be easily extended and maintained.```
Implementing all of these features will be a significant undertaking, but with dedication and hard work, you can create your own game engine that rivals commercial engines like Unity and Unreal Engine. Good luck!
