#### I did above steps and successfully i got a triangle using OpenGL in a window using GLFW and GLEW. now tell how to enhance and go for big things like creating an app or something like unit or unreal engine development features. Give steps in detail and codes to implement to create an app like unreal engine with all functionalities it has. You can go through internet and read or go through documentation to find all functionalities and implement in our app. you can follow below methods also use internet also to give insightful codes and path: here are some high-level steps you can take to enhance your game engine and add more features:
```
Implement a Scene Graph: A scene graph is a data structure that represents the hierarchical relationships between objects in a scene. You can use a scene graph to manage the rendering, transformations, and interactions between objects.
Implement a Resource Manager: A resource manager is a system that manages the loading, unloading, and caching of game resources, such as textures, models, and shaders.
Implement a Physics Engine: A physics engine is a system that simulates physical behaviors, such as collisions, rigid body dynamics, and soft body dynamics. You can use a physics engine to add realism to your game.
Implement a Scripting System: A scripting system allows game developers to add custom behaviors to game objects using a scripting language, such as Lua or Python. This can make it easier for non-programmers to create game logic.
Implement a User Interface System: A user interface system allows you to create menus, buttons, and other interactive elements that the player can use to interact with the game.
Implement a Networking System: A networking system allows you to create multiplayer games that can be played over a network.
Implement a 3D Rendering Pipeline: A 3D rendering pipeline is a series of steps that transform 3D models into 2D images that can be displayed on the screen. You can use techniques like shading, lighting, and post-processing to enhance the visual quality of your game.
Implement a Sound System: A sound system allows you to play sounds and music in your game.
Implement an Animation System: An animation system allows you to create animations for game objects and characters.
Optimize Performance: Game engines need to be highly optimized to run efficiently on a wide range of hardware. You can use techniques like occlusion culling, level of detail, and multi-threading to improve performance.
I recommend checking out game development resources like GameDev.net, Gamasutra, and the Game Programming Patterns book. You can also study the source code of open-source game engines like Godot, OGRE, and Irrlicht to see how they implement these features. But use your own way because we can do unachieavable things just believe we can.
