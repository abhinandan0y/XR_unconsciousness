#### creating your own game engine

guide to get you started:

Start Small: Begin by creating a simple engine that can render 2D or 3D graphics. You can use libraries like OpenGL, DirectX, or Vulkan for this.
```bash

```
Implement Basic Systems: Once you have a rendering engine, you can start implementing other basic systems, like a physics engine for simulating physics, an input system for handling user input, and an audio system for playing sounds.

Implement AI Systems: With your intermediate knowledge of AI techniques, you can start implementing AI systems. This could involve creating a pathfinding system for navigation, a decision tree system for making decisions, or a machine learning system for more complex behaviors.

Create a Scripting System: A scripting system allows game developers to create game logic without modifying the engine's source code. You can use languages like C# or JavaScript for this.

Integrate Tools: Tools like level editors and animation editors can make it easier for game developers to create games with your engine.

Test and Iterate: Continually test your engine and make improvements. This will likely involve creating small games with your engine to test its capabilities.

Documentation and Community Building: Good documentation is crucial for others to use your engine effectively. Building a community can also provide valuable feedback and contributions to your project.
